## July 12th, 2018

These are the notes for our first ever community call, held at 11:00am EDT
on Thursday, July 12th, 2018.

1. **The Website**

   We have a website at <https://shieldproject.io>.

   We are putting all of our documentation, guides, and manuals there

   Work is underway on fleshing out the
   [SHIELD Operator's Manual](/docs/manual), and the
   [Plugin Reference](/docs/plugins).

   We're also hoping to build out recipe-based docs like
   _How do I backup Cloud Foundry?_

2. **The Trello Board**

   We have started using a [Trello Board][trello] for coordinating developer
   activity.  If you want to get involved in hacking on SHIELD, ask in
   the #help channel on [Slack][slack].

   Github Issues will still be the place to report bugs and ask for feature
   requests.  Trello is more for things that require multiple different
   states, prioritization, backlog management, etc.

   Every month we will be highlighting delivered features and fixed bugs
   that we feel are important enough to announce (big, operator-visible
   stuff), and discussing our focus for the next month.

3. **Current Future Direction**

   We've got a lot of minor bugs in the Trello backlog; we're focusing on
   those first, to get them fixed and get the fixes shipped.

   We've also conducted an internal review, which we're calling _Gap
   Analysis_.  Put simply, it's all the things we haven't finished, and all
   the features we know we need but haven't implemented.  This includes
   things like being able to edit systems from the web interface, viewing
   tasks, rescheduling backup jobs, etc.

   Once we've got the bug backlog tamed, we'll be moving onto the gap
   tickets.

4. **Release Cadence**

   We're hoping to hit a weekly release schedule with SHIELD, the SHIELD
   BOSH release, and the SHIELD Genesis Kit.  Our current plan is to cut new
   point releases on Friday afternoons.

5. **Open Forum**

   Jordan asked a bunch of questions.  Thanks, mate!

   - **CLI Help Documentation** - Curious whether or not we were going to
     provide more documentation for CLI usage, either via the website, or
     inline via `--help` flags.

     Short answer: yes.

     Long answer: definitely yes, via both methods.  We'll review the state
     of SHIELD help inside the CLI, and see if there are logical places to
     flesh out what we've got, cover more abstract topics, etc.

   - **Can SHIELD itself be recovered via the CLI only?**

     Currently, no.  The SHIELD recovery mechanism (with the fixed key
     backup) relies on visual elements that are part of the Web UI.
     However, it's a good feature (one we're missing, so it's a "gap"),
     and we'll be looking into support for that particular workflow.

   - **Manual Archive Management** - Having deleted archives manually from
     backing cloud storage, Jordan noticed that the SHIELD Web UI didn't
     update its storage usage counts.

     This is normal, and we'll address it specifically in the documentation,
     since SHIELD expects to have full and complete control over cloud
     storage.  We did talk through a UI view (CLI and Web) for browsing cloud
     storage archives, and deleting them there, with an eye towards reclaiming
     space.

   - **Monitoring and Notifications** - Is it possible to notify about storage
     usage limits being reached, failing storage, failing jobs, etc.?

     Short answer: yes, via the `/v2/health` endpoint, in an external
     monitoring system.

     Long answer: we have plans for a separate project / product, for handling
     notifications more globally, with business logic and dispatch rules built
     into _that_ system, which SHIELD would then integrate with.

Thanks all for joining!  See you next month!
