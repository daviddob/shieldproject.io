      ## Battle-Tested

      In this latest version of SHIELD we did some serious stress-testing of
      the inner bits and bobs, and flushed out a bunch of oddball deadlocks
      that, while not _likely_ to occur in production, are at least
      possible.

      From the database layer to the websockets-infused message bus, things
      are a whole lot more stable in 8.4.1, in the face of poor network
      conditions, misbehaving clients, and even malicious actors!
