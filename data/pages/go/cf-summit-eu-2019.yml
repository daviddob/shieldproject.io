      ## Just in Time for CFEU 2019!

      The SHIELD Project is pleased to announce the immediate availability
      of version 8.4.1 of the cloud-native data protection solution for
      Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes!

      ## Battle-Tested

      In this latest version of SHIELD we did some serious stress-testing of
      the inner bits and bobs, and flushed out a bunch of oddball deadlocks
      that, while not _likely_ to occur in production, are at least
      possible.

      From the database layer to the websockets-infused message bus, things
      are a whole lot more stable in 8.4.1, in the face of poor network
      conditions, misbehaving clients, and even malicious actors!

      ## Now With etcd Support

      SHIELD can now back up your etcd key-value stores.  Perfect
      for those Kubernetes clusters you've been meaning to backup...
