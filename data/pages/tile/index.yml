Welcome to the documentation for the SHILED Enterprise Data Protection Tile beta.

# What is SHIELD?

SHIELD is a _data protection_ solution. It is designed to run scheduled
tasks to backup your important data systems to off-site cloud storage
solutions, and facilitate the restoration of backup archives in the event of
outages or data loss.

# Where Can I Get SHIELD?

SHIELD will ultimately be available on Pivnet but for this beta phase you can
find it [here](#).

# How do I install SHIELD?
1. Once you have the tile downloaded, navigate to your Pivotal Operations Manager
   and click `Import Product` and select the tile from your personal machine.

2. Right under `Import Product` find the versioned shield tile and click `+` to
   begin staging the tile

# Configuring the Tile

The first required fields for the install are associated with the identity of SHIELD

![identity](/tile/identity.png)

From here we need to specify:

- `Environment Name`. This is named used to identify the SHILED itself as well
  as target your SHIELD instance with the cli.

- `Domain`. The domain in which you will be using for shield.

- `Web Interface Color`. A color to help better identify this shield. This is often
  useful when dealing with multiple shield across multiple environments.

- `Message of the Day` An optional message of the day that gets displayed on the login page.
  This can be used to further describe and differentiate multiple shields.

![scheduling](/tile/scheduling.png)

There are three optional properties available for adjusting how SHIELD schedules jobs.

From here we can specify:

- `Scheduler Threads`. Threads determine how many concurrent tasks shield core can perform at once.
  More threads will allow more backup/restore operations at one time, but requires more cpu and ram.

- `Slow Loop Interval`. How often (in secconds) SHIELD performs non critical operations such as cloud storage
  viability tests, archive purgation, storage analysis calculations, etc.

- `Task Execution Timeout`. How long (in hours) a task can run before the SHIELD core considers it stalled
  and cancels its execution.

![authentication](/tile/authentication.png)

We now need to configure our authentication details for SHIELD.

From here we can specify:

- `Sesion Timeout`. Maximum lifetime (in hours) of an authenticated session, either web or CLI.

- `Failsafe Account Username`. When SHIELD core starts up it checks the local users database, and if it finds
  no users it will create the failsafe account. This allows you to provide secure default credentials.

- `Failsafe Account Password`. The required secret password for the failsafe account, you can change this after
  SHIELD deploys and your changes will persist.

- `Authentication Provider JSON Config`. The raw SHIELD authentication provider configuration, for using GitHub
  and/or PCF UAA to authenticate SHIELD users. Examples for [github](https://github.com/starkandwayne/shield/blob/master/docs/auth/github.md) and [uaa](https://github.com/starkandwayne/shield/blob/master/docs/auth/uaa.md) can be found here.

![storage](/tile/storage.png)

We can now set system wide archive rention policies.

From here we can specify:

- `Minimum Retention Period`. The shortest allowed retention period (in days).

- `Maximum Retention Period`. The longest allowed retention period (in days).

![security](/tile/security.png)

- `API TLS`. The x509 certificate used for the SHIELD API signed for your shield domain and 127.0.0.1.
