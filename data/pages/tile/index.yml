Welcome to the documentation for the SHILED Enterprise Data Protection Tile beta.

# What is SHIELD?

SHIELD is a _data protection_ solution. It is designed to run scheduled
tasks to backup your important data systems to off-site cloud storage
solutions, and facilitate the restoration of backup archives in the event of
outages or data loss.

# Where Can I Get SHIELD?

SHIELD will ultimately be available on Pivnet but for this beta phase you can
find it [here](#).

# How do I install SHIELD?
1. Once you have the tile downloaded, navigate to your Pivotal Operations Manager
   and click `Import Product` and select the tile from your personal machine.

2. Right under `Import Product` find the versioned shield tile and click `+` to
   begin staging the tile

# Configuring the Tile

The first required fields for the install are associated with the identity of SHIELD

![identity](/Tile/identity.png)

From here we need to specify:

- `Environment Name`. This is named used to identify the SHILED itself as well
  as target your SHIELD instance with the cli.

- `Domain`. The domain in which you will be using for shield.

- `Web Interface Color`. A color to help better identify this shield. This is often
  useful when dealing with multiple shield across multiple environments.

- `Message of the Day` An optional message of the day that gets displayed on the login page.
  This can be used to further describe and differentiate multiple shields.

![scheduling](/Tile/scheduling.png)

There are three optional properties available for adjusting how SHIELD schedules jobs.

From here we can specify:

- `Scheduler Threads`. Threads determine how many concurrent tasks shield core can perform at once.
  More threads will allow more backup/restore operations at one time, but requires more cpu and ram.

- `Slow Loop Interval`. How often (in secconds) SHIELD performs non critical operations such as cloud storage
  viability tests, archive purgation, storage analysis calculations, etc.

- `Task Execution Timeout`. How long (in hours) a task can run before the SHIELD core considers it stalled
  and cancels its execution.

We now need to configure our authentication
