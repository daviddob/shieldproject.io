## Databases

### `mongo` - MongoDB NoSQL Database

The `mongo` plugin lets you back up and restore your MongoDB databases.
It relies on the `mongodump` and `mongorestore` utilities, installed on the
agent host.

#### Configuration Options

- `mongo_host` - The IP address or host name of the MongoDB installation to
  target.  This defaults to `127.0.0.1`, but can be changed to allow for
  remote backup/restore, from a network-attached SHIELD agent.

- `mongo_port` - The TCP port to connect to, which the `mongod` process
  should be listening to.  Defaults to `27017`, the standard MongoDB port.

- `mongo_user` - The name of the user account to authenticate to MongoDB as,
  for performing both backup and restore tasks.  If not specified, no
  authentication is performed.

- `mongo_password` - The password to use when authenticating with
  the `mongo_user` account.

- `mongo_database` - The name of a specific database to back up.
  By default, all databases will be included in the backup archive.

  **Note:** This setting has _no effect_ on restore -- whatever is included
  in the backup archive will be restored.

- `mongo_bindir` - The path to the directory which contains the dump and
  restore binaries.
  Defaults to `/var/vcap/packages/shield-mongo/bin`, which works well with
  the [SHIELD MongoDB Addon][shield-mongo].
//If not specified, the plugin will attempt to find both `mongodump` and `mongorestore` via the agent's plugin paths setting.

- `mongo_options` - A set of arbitrary command-line flags to pass to the
  dump and restore tools.  For example, `--ssl` will enable SSL/TLS when
  communicating with MongoDB.  Refer to the MongoDB documentation for more
  details.


#### Co-locating the SHIELD MongoDB Addon

If you are running the SHIELD agent on a different machine than your MongoDB
database server, you will need to install the [SHIELD MongoDB Addon][shield-mongo]
to get the mongodump and monogrestore tools.

Add the release to the top-level `releases:` section in your agent
deployment manifest:

    releases:
      - name:    shield-addon-mongodb
        version: latest   # or a specific version

Then add the job that corresponds to the version of MongoDB you want to
backup:

    instance_groups:
      - name: your-shield-agent
        jobs:
          - release: shield-addon-mongodb
            name:    shield-addon-mongo-tools-3.4

Check the [addon's README][shield-mongo] for full details of available
versions.


### `mysql` - MySQL / MariaDB Relational Database

The `mysql` plugin lets you back up and restore MySQL / MariaDB databases,
using the pure-SQL `mysqldump` utility.  For very large database, the time
spent serializing database records into SQL commands may be prohibitive, and
you may want to investigate use of the `xtrabackup` plugin instead.

Restores are handled by feeding the SQL backup through the standard `mysql`
utility.  Connected clients will remain connected during restore.

#### Configuration Options

- `mysql_host` - The IP address or host name of the MySQL database server to
  target.  This defaults to `127.0.0.1`, but can be changed to allow for
  remote backup/restore, from a network-attached SHIELD agent.

- `mysql_port` - The TCP port to connect to, which the database process
  should be listening to.  Defaults to `3306`, the standard MySQL port.

- `mysql_user` **(required)** - The username to authenticate with.

- `mysql_password` **(required)** - The password for the `mysql_user`.

- `mysql_read_replica` - The IP address or host name of a read replica
  database server.  If specified, back up operations will be carried out
  against this host, instead of `mysql_host`.

- `mysql_database` - The name of a single database to back up.
  By default, all databases will be included in the backup archive.

  **Note:** this setting has _no effect_ on restore -- whatever is included
  in the backup archive will be restored.

- `mysql_bindir` - The path to the directory which contains the `mysql` and
  `mysqldump` utilties.
  Defaults to `/var/vcap/packages/shield-mysql/bin`, which works well with
  the [SHIELD MariaDB Addon][shield-mysql].
//If not specified, the plugin will attempt to find both `mysqldump` and `mysql` via the agent's plugin paths setting.

- `mysql_options` - A set of `mysqldump` command-line flags.
  Refer to the MySQL documentation to see what you can set.

#### Co-locating the SHIELD MariaDB Addon

If you are running the SHIELD agent on a different machine than your MySQL
database server, you will need to install the [SHIELD MariaDB Addon][shield-mysql]
to get the mysqldump and mysql tools.

Add the release to the top-level `releases:` section in your agent
deployment manifest:

    releases:
      - name:    shield-addon-mysql
        version: latest   # or a specific version

Then add the job that corresponds to the version of MySQL or MariaDB you
want to backup:

    instance_groups:
      - name: your-shield-agent
        jobs:
          - release: shield-addon-mysql
            name:    shield-addon-mariadb-10.2
            # or, if you are running mysql
            #name:   shield-addon-mysql-5.7

Check the [addon's README][shield-mysql] for full details of available
versions.


### `postgres` - PostgreSQL Relational Database

The `postgres` plugin lets you back up and restore PostgreSQL databases.
It uses standard PostgreSQL tooling for backups: `pg_dump` and `pg_dumpall`
for backups, and `psql` to restore.

During restore, connected clients will be forcibly disconnected so that the
databases they were using can be dropped and recreated.  This happens
transparently, but does require that client software be able to gracefully
reconnect as needed.

#### Configuration Options

- `pg_host` - The IP address or host name of the PostgreSQL database server
  to target.  If this is not set, the plugin will connect _locally_, using
  the UNIX domain socket (usually somewhere in `/var`).

  **Note:** If you explicitly want to connect over loopback via TCP, you
  have to explicitly set `pg_host` to 127.0.0.1.

- `pg_port` - The port that the PostgreSQL database software is listening to
  for client connections.  Defaults to `5432`, the standard PostgreSQL port.

- `pg_user` - The username to authenticate as.  If you leave this blank, the
  UID of the SHIELD agent process will be used.  For BOSH deployments, this
  is usually `vcap`, which is generally what you want for local agents.

- `pg_password` - The password to authenticate as.  For local agents
  (connecting over loopback TCP, or via the UNIX domain socket) you can
  often leave this blank, especially in most BOSH deployments.

- `pg_database` - The name of a single database to back up.
  By default, all databases will be included in the backup archive.

- `pg_read_replica_host` - The IP address or host name of a read replica
  database server.  If specified, back up operations will be carried out
  against this host, insteadf of `pg_host`.

- `pg_read_replica_port` - The TCP port that the read replica is listening
  on.  This has no effect if `pg_read_replica_host` is not set.  It defaults
  to the value of `pg_port`.

- `pg_bindir` - The path to the directory which contains the PostgreSQL dump
  utilities, and psql.  Defaults to `/var/vcap/packages/postgres-9.4/bin`.
//If not specified, the plugin will attempt to find `pgdump`, `pg_dumpall`, and `psql` via the agent's plugin paths setting.

#### Co-locating the SHIELD PostgreSQL Addon

If you are running the SHIELD agent on a different machine than your PostgreSQL
database server, you will need to install the [SHIELD PostgreSQL Addon][shield-postgres]
to get the pg\_dump, pg\_dumpall and psql tools.

Add the release to the top-level `releases:` section in your agent
deployment manifest:

    releases:
      - name:    shield-addon-postgres
        version: latest   # or a specific version

Then add the job that corresponds to the version of PostgreSQL you want to
backup:

    instance_groups:
      - name: your-shield-agent
        jobs:
          - release: shield-addon-postgres
            name:    shield-addon-postgres-10.1

Check the [addon's README][shield-postgres] for full details of available
versions.


### `xtrabackup` - MySQL Backups via `xtrabackup` CLI

The `xtrabackup` plugin lets you back up and restore your MySQL / MariaDB
databases using a filesystem-based approach leveraging the `xtrabackup`
utility.  This method is often faster, if less portable, than the pure SQL
approach taken by the `mysql` plugin.

**Note:** Since xtrabackup requires access to the MySQL / MariaDB data
directory, it can only be run from the database host itself.

### Configuration Options

- `mysql_user` **(required)** - The username to authenticate with.

- `mysql_password` **(required)** - The password for the `mysql_user`.

- `mysql_socket` - The path to the MySQL UNIX domain socket.
  Defaults to `/var/vcap/sys/run/mysql/mysqld.sock`.

- `mysql_databases` - A comma-separated list of databases to back up.
  By default, all databases are included in the backup archive.

  **Note:** this setting has _no effect_ on restore -- whatever is included
  in the backup archive will be restored.

- `mysql_datadir` - The path to the directory which contains the MySQL data
  files.  The SHIELD agent (effective) user needs read access to this
  directory for backups, and write access for restores.

  Defaults to `/var/lib/mysql`

- `mysql_temp_targetdir` - The path to a temporary filesystem workspace for
  the xtrabackup tool to work.  This directory must be empty, and the
  underlying filesystem must be at least as large as the complete MySQL
  database(s) being backed up.

  Defaults to `/tmp/backups`.

- `mysql_xtrabackup` - The path to the `xtrabackup` binary.
  Defaults to `/var/vcap/packages/shield-mysql/bin/xtrabackup`, which works
  well with the [SHIELD MariaDB Addon][shield-mysql].
//If not specified, the plugin will attempt to find `xtrabackup` via the agent's plugin paths setting.

- `mysql_tar` - The path to the `tar` binary.
  If not specified, the plugin will attempt to find `tar` via the agent's
  plugin paths setting.


#### Co-locating the SHIELD MariaDB Addon

If your MySQL installation does not include xtrabackup, you will need to
install the [SHIELD MariaDB Addon][shield-mysql].

Add the release to the top-level `releases:` section in your agent
deployment manifest:

    releases:
      - name:    shield-addon-mysql
        version: latest   # or a specific version

Then add the job that corresponds to the version of MySQL or MariaDB you
want to backup:

    instance_groups:
      - name: your-shield-agent
        jobs:
          - release: shield-addon-mysql
            #name:   shield-addon-xtrabackup-2.4

Check the [addon's README][shield-mysql] for full details of available
versions.
