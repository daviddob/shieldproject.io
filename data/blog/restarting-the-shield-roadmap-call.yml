  In the summer of 2018, the SHIELD Team started holding monthly
  _Roadmap Calls_ to keep interested parties updated and involved in the
  goings-on of SHIELD.  At some point, we stopped holding those.  Now, we're
  restarting them again.  Come talk to us!

This month (August of 2019), we resumed holding regularly scheduled _Roadmap
Calls_, where the developers and release engineers working on SHIELD
provide updates, explain where we are at in the roadmap, where we want to
go, and answer questions form anyone who pops in.

We'll be holding these calls on the **4th Thursday** of every month at **11am
EDT**.  More details can be found on the [Community Roadmap Call page][1]
(on shieldproject.io).

We will be continuing our policy of _not_ recording these calls.  We've
watched recorded community board calls and they are super boring.  The team
also feels that recording calls can give some people undue apprehension wth
respect to getting involved, and may actively deter some from participating.

We _will_ continue providing written meeting minutes (probably accompanied
by blog posts) on the [shieldproject.io][1] website.

We hope that these calls help to put faces to names, and remind everyone
involves that the people who create SHIELD and the people who use SHIELD
are just that: people.  It's all too easy to get lost in the clean lines of
GitHub and forget that behind those screen names are living, breathing human
beings.

We also want to have a forum in which to discuss the direction of the
project, its velocity in pursuing that direction, and more.  So [stop on
in][1], say hi, and join in the fun!
