            <h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Submit buttons on forms now (a) disable themselves when clicked
and (b) change their text to indicate an ongoing operation.
This greatly increases the usability of the web UI.  See #505</p></li>
<li><p>The web UI for rekeying SHIELD Core now correctly identifies
when the operator would like to rotate the fixed key.  Also, the
error messaging for an incorrect <em>current</em> master password is
better now, and by default, the "rotate fixed key" checkbox on
the rekeying form is off.  See #546</p></li>
<li><p>The default password for the failsafe account has been changed
from <code>shield</code> to <code>password</code>, for more continuity across various
packaging formats.  See #531</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>shield tasks</code> command (and the backing API) can now filter
tasks based on their task type (i.e. "backup", or "restore")
See #523</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Encryption</code> column of the system detail page's backup jobs
table now <em>always</em> shows something.  For jobs that do not used
the fixed key, the new tag is <code>randomized</code>.  See #536</p></li>
<li><p>SHIELD now tracks when it last checked each agent separately
from when it last "saw" the agent.  <em>Last Seen</em> now means the
point in time when the agent last connected to the SHIELD core,
and <em>Last Checked</em> is when the core last connected to the agent
for metadata retrieval.</p></li>
<li><p>SHIELD now allows agents to change their IP address; only the
agent name is unchangeable.  Previously, attempts to change an
agents registered IP address (without changing its name) would
fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Both the SHIELD Agent and the SHIELD CLI now trust the system
X.509 CA Certificate Stores.  See #555 and #556</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The MotD separator no longer displays if the MotD is empty
or not specified.  See #530</p></li>
<li><p>The Ad Hoc Backup and Restore wizards now handle the "empty"
state more gracefully, and instead of showing an empty table
when there are no data systems, they warn you that you have
no systems to backup or restore.  See #532 and #533</p></li>
<li><p>Stores (global and tenant-specific) can now be properly deleted
via the web UI and CLI.</p></li>
<li><p>When editing targets and stores on the webui changes are now
persisted when editing again without a refresh.</p></li>
<li><p>The "Agents of SHIELD" admin page no longer gets stuck in a
loading loop whenever websocket events are seen.</p></li>
<li><p>Global Storage Configuration details are now properly loaded
when accessing a global store detail page from the admin panel.
Previously, the details would only load if you visited the
global store from the "Storage Systems" (non-admin) top-level,
which only works if you actually have a tenant.  See #535</p></li>
<li><p><code>shield annotate-archive</code> now works with short uuids</p></li>
<li><p>Orphaned archives from a target deletion no longer prevent users
from loggin into SHIELD</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>mongo</code> plugin now handles hosts with embedded ports,
allowing operators to configure multi-node mongo across
different ports on the same node, without <code>--port</code> getting in
the way.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>mongo</code> plugin now allows you to authenticate against a
database <em>other</em> than "admin" (which remains the default).</p></li>

          <h2 id="v8.2.1">SHIELD v8.2.1</h2>
          <h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>swift</code> plugin now supports the Openstack v3 Identity API</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>vault</code> plugin now supports k/v v2 endpoints, which are
now the default in contemporary versions of Vault.</p></li>

          <h2 id="v8.2.0">SHIELD v8.2.0</h2>
          <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>shieldd</code> binary now properly reports its release version in
both CLI (<code>-v</code>) and web UI contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>The archives list on the system page now no longer gives you the
option of restoring invalid archives (i.e. purged stuff).
Thanks @thomasmitchell for finding and reporting in #506.</p></li>
<li><p>System-initiated archive purges now properly set the store agent
for purgation, so that the purge task has someone to talk to for
removal of the archive from cloud storage.  See #514.</p></li>
<li><p>The core scheduler now immediately fails any task for which the
remote SHIELD agent does not signal a successful (rc=0) exit
status.  This should clean up some task logs, and remove red
herring issues like JSON unmarshal failures, while
simultaneously ensuring that failed purge tasks are re-tried.
See #518.</p></li>
<li><p>Purge tasks are now being properly supplied with the restore key
necessary for deleting the archive blob.  See #516.</p></li>
<li><p>Agent Status tasks (op <code>agent-status</code>) were not previously being
created with proper global tenant association.  This prohibited
operators from viewing the details of those tasks.  We fixed
this, and added a data fixup created to re-associate existing
tasks.  See #522.</p></li>
<li><p>The HUD now always registers the global cloud storage in its
health data, so operators are aware of all issues with storaage
systems that they might be using, global or tenant-private.
See #504.</p></li>
<li><p>Jobs created via the Web UI now properly set their "KeepN"
attribute, which was missing from the ingestion / insertion.
Accompanying this is a new data fixup that should re-calculate
the <code>keep_n</code> database field wherever it is zero.  See #460.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlocking SHIELD was not properly giving feedback when a wrong
password was given or no password at all. This is now working.
See #524.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously we had issues doing a fs backup and restore of SHIELD
itself. Improvments to the fs plugin, and fixing permissions issues
within core now allow SHIELD to properly backup and restore itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>All <code>-v</code> handlers in CLI utilities now properly handle the 'dev'
version as analogous to the empty ('') version, and revert to
reporting the version of the binary as '(development)'.  This is
mainly for packaing Docker images properly.</p></li>
<li><p>All <code>shield*</code> CLI utilities, include the <code>shield</code> CLI itself,
the <code>shieldd</code> daemon, and all helper binaries now sport options
for getting their usage (<code>--help</code>) and versions (<code>--versions</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>s3</code> plugin now accepts a URL as its <code>s3_host</code> endpoint
parameter, affording operators more flexibility.
The alternative was confusion!  See #509.</p></li>
<li><p>When purging archives manually, you can now supply
human-friendly reasons for the purge.  For example, if the data
is known to be bad in that particular vintage of the target
system, you can purge the archives containing it, and explain
that.  See #520</p></li>
<li><p>Archives can now be annotated from the command-line, with the
<code>annotate-archive</code> command.</p></li>
<li><p>Manually purged archives now track their reason for purge as
"manually purged", instead of "expired".  See #517.</p></li>
<li><p>All system- and tenant-level objects can now be searched for,
and referenced by short UUIDs.  This is huge (though short),
going a long way to making the CLI easier to work with.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Release Engineering</h3>

<ul>
<li>Docker images can now be built with embedded release versions,
for non-dev distribution as a container image.</li>

          <h2 id="v8.1.0">SHIELD v8.1.0</h2>
          <h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The SHIELD Web UI now allows you to download the SHIELD CLI
directly, for both MacOS (Darwin) and Linux.  From now on,
SHIELD releases will include the paired version of the CLI.</p></li>
<li><p>We now support minutely backups, but only from the CLI.</p></li>
<li><p>New <code>shield op pry</code> for decrypting and inspecting the contents
of a SHIELD Vault Crypt.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>SHIELD now cleans up the Vault when archives are marked as
expired (for purgation).</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduled jobs no longer "stack" in the queue.  If SHIELD goes
to schedule a backup and an existing task is in-flight for the
same job, an already-cancelled task is stored in the database,
as a placeholder to the task that should have run.</p></li>
<li><p>Storage Health Check Tasks no longer stack.  SHIELD only allows
one in-flight task for a given Cloud Storage System, at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>shield</code> CLI now handles API endpoints with any number of
trailing forward slash (<code>/</code>) characters.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Web UI page dispatch logic now properly cancels all outstanding
AJAX requests, to avoid a rather annoying lag/delay UX issue
where pages would flip "back" to a previous node in the history,
because a delayed AJAX request was still working away in the
background.</p></li>
<li><p><code>shield import</code> now honors the <code>paused</code> setting on jobs that it
creates on your behalf.</p></li>

          <h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>We now have a BackBlaze B2 storage plugin!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Ordinals are now optional in monthly schedule specs (via the web
UI), allowing front-end users to type '3' or '3rd', per their
strongly-held personal preference.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>token</code> field of the <code>vault</code> plugins is now marked as a
<em>password</em>, so that autocompletion in the browser gets turned off.
Otherwise, Chrome/FF keeps wanting to leak your Vault tokens to
people.</p></li>
<li><p>The data directory and web UI root configurations are now
properly validated by the SHIELD core.  If they do not exist,
core startup is halted.  That way, you find out sooner if you've
misconfigured something.  Wheee.</p></li>
<li><p><code>shield import</code> can now properly import fixed-key backup jobs.
Just what the doctor ordered for BOSH and SHIELD backup and
recovery.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Errors with hourly schedules are now properly handled and give a
readable error message to the front-end.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>mysql</code> plugin can now properly restore a single database.</p></li>
<li><p>Some silly typos (some copy-pasta, some bad whitespace, some
we-don't-know-what-we-were-thinking) have been fixed in SHIELD
CLI <code>--help</code> output.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Credentials in task log output are now displayed as a blurred white block,

          <h2 id="v8.0.14">SHIELD v8.0.14</h2>
          <h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Compression of archives is now optional, on a per-target basis.
If you have really big databases and don't want to bother compressing
them, you can now turn that off and get done with your data protection
tasks sooner!</p></li>
<li><p>The Tasks API now has new time boundary range parameters, for retrieving
tasks based on when they started and/or stopped.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The Systems and Storage views now have the ability to toggle between a
card-based layout (the default), and a table layout.</p></li>
<li><p>Tags in the Systems View Timeline are now only shown for non-backup tasks,
and only for successfully completed tasks.  In practice, this means that
restore operations get tags and no one else does.</p></li>
<li><p>The Retention Policy API / UI / CLI is better.  Namely, the API matches
the documation (it's a PATCH not a PUT), and we have proper bounds
checking on expiry days and policy name lengths.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>When restoring archives with the CLI, and targeting a different data
system than the archive originally came from, everything works as
expected.</li>

          <h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Move the <code>vault.crypt</code> file out from under the <code>vault/</code> data
directory sub-directory; that sub-directory is dedicated to the
Vault instance, and we shouldn't be putting other things in there.</p></li>
<li><p>Threshold for storage now indicates the use of units in the form field, to
prevent the accidental specification of 50 bytes when you meant 50 gigabytes.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved results of the /v2/info and /v2/heath API endpoints to match its
documented behaviour.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Deprecations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Removed FQDN from /v2/info as it was populated using DNS reverse lookups
that were less than useful.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Storage health correctly stated during creation of ad-hoc runs.</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduled jobs in timeline are not longer incorrectly as "Ad-hoc"</p></li>
<li><p>Admin/Sessions page no longer shows all IP Addresses as <code>localhost</code> and
shows the session creation time in human-readable format.</p></li>
<li><p>Notes for targets are now displayed on the page for a given system.</p></li>
<li><p>Errors encountered when unlocking the vault now notify the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Release version correctly displayed on header instead of <code>(development)</code></p></li>

backup configuration wizard in the web UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Storage systems now properly report their health to all
front-end views, fixing a few fixmes along the way.</p></li>
<li><p>Agents can now be resynchronized, in an ad hoc fashion, via the
admin backend on the web UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Jobs will have their 'next run' time re-calculated when their
schedule is changed.  Previously, the existing schedule was in
force until the first run after a schedule change, at which
point the new schedule kicked in.  This was weird, so we changed
it.</p></li>
<li><p>New Cloud Storage Solutions (global or tenant-based) are
considered healthy until proven broken.</p></li>
<li><p><code>shield-agent</code> now has better logging to help troubleshoot
registration problems.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Fix an egregious bug in the scheduling logic that was only
considering jobs scheduled in the future to be "overdue".
Since all jobs start out with a next_run of 0, this caused NO
JOBS to ever be scheduled.  Thankfully, 8.x is still beta.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix a segfault when dereferencing a nil Task during a broadcast.
Now, we log that we got a nil task, to assist in tracking down
why / where its occurring, rather than just crashing on panic.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>shield restore-archive</code> command now prints out the UUID of
the task scheduled to run the restore, rather than the cryptic
(and oh-so-unhelpful) string "%s!:bool=true"</p></li>
<li><p>Neither <code>shield create-job</code>, nor <code>shield update-job</code> will allow
you to create (or modify) jobs to have invalid, unparseable
schedules.  This will keep the CLI from accidentally creating
schedules that the web UI can't process.</p></li>
<li><p>When restoring through the new wizard, the web UI only shows
archives for the selected target system, instead of all of the
archives every made for the tenant.  Turns out this was less
than useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix up some edge cases where we weren't checking for the
existence of a tenant in tenant-scope API calls, just the rights
to that tenant -- since system users can affect all tenants, we
found that we could create child objects on non-existent
tenants.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Developer Stuff</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><code>bin/testdev</code> now runs a WebDAV service on the nginx reverse
proxy (on <code>$PORT+1</code>), since we can no longer use the <code>fs</code> plugin
for storage operations.</p>

<p>On MacOS, with homebrew, you'll want to reinstall nginx with
WebDAV support: <code>brew reinstall --with-webdav nginx</code></p></li>

          <h2 id="v8.0.7">SHIELD v8.0.7</h2>
          <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><code>shield-agent</code> will now propagate HTTP proxy environment
variables: <code>http_proxy</code>, <code>https_proxy</code> and <code>no_proxy</code>, which
some plugins (i.e. s3) can make use of.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>postgres</code> plugin no longer requires a host address.  If not
specified, a local loopback (usually UNIX domain socket) will be
attempted.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>postgres</code> plugin no longer requires a password.  If not
specified, no authentication credentials will be sent.  This is
usually paired with an empty (or missing) pg_host, to gain
superuser access over loopback (given a 'trust' entry in HBA)</p></li>

assignment logic that lead to different behaviors depending on
how Github returned org/team memberships.</li>

          <h2 id="v8.0.5">SHIELD v8.0.5</h2>
          <h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The Github OAuth provider now properly handles Github Enterprise
for API work (user lookups, org lookups, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>The Github OAuth provider can now handle assignment across
multiple tenants (including SYSTEM) from a single Github Org.</p></li>
<li><p>Shield CLI has been renamed from <code>buckler</code> back to <code>shield</code> similar
to previous versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Added Cassandra target plugin.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Fix a missing slash in the Github Authentication Provider
display, in the administrative backend.</p></li>
<li><p>The Web UI now propagates the job name from the configuration
wizard to the API, replacing 'a random name?' with something
just a bit less ... random.</p></li>

          <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The v8 Web UI now properly renders target plugin forms, based
on the metadata provided by the plugins themselves.  Previously,
only the fs plugin was working, due to the next bug we fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>The fs plugin was mistakenly reporting a store field, something
that got missed when we removed its ability to act as a store
plugin.</p></li>
<li><p>The swift plugin now features field metadata.</p></li>

          <p><strong>SHIELD 8.x is still beta software; not recommended for production deployment</strong></p>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>SHIELD now supports Fixed Key encryption for disaster recovery
of backups for SHIELD itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>s3</code> plugin now uses pathd buckets, so it should work better
with S3-workalikes that don't support DNS-style buckets.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>fs</code> plugin strips the base director from the files as they
are archived, allowing archives to be portably replayed to
different base directors on restore.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>mysql</code> and <code>xtrabackup</code> plugins are better now.</p></li>
<li><p><code>buckler import</code> works better now, no longer requiring a SHIELD
core (via either <code>--core</code> or <code>$SHIELD_CORE</code>).  It also now
supports skipping TLS verification of the SHIELD Core.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Plugins now accept boolish strings and numbers in place of
actual booleans.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle symlinks in the <code>fs</code> plugin</p></li>
<li><p>The S3 plugin now properly sets a multipart upload chunk size
of 5 MEGABYTES, not 5 GIGABYTES, so we don't OOM on VMs.  Oops.</p></li>
<li><p>The WebUI can now display OAuth provider configuration (again).</p></li>
<li><p><code>buckler create-policy</code> now properly validates the expiry value
as a number.</p></li>
<li><p>SHIELD Core no longer leaks file descriptors when talking to the
sealed Vaults.</p></li>

          <h2 id="v8.0.1">SHIELD v8.0.1</h2>
          <p><strong>SHIELD 8.x is still beta software; not recommended for production deployment</strong></p>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>azure</code> plugin now features a <code>path_prefix</code> setting to allow
sharing of a single Azure Blobstore container amongst several
jobs and/or SHIELDs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>fs</code> plugin no longer relies on the <code>bsdtar</code> executable to
function; instead, all tarball creation / extraction is handled
directly by the plugin code, making it easier to deploy.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>test-store</code> and <code>purge</code> tasks that are scheduled in the
slow loop are now skipped if the Vault is sealed.  This keeps
the task list from growing with lots of tasks that will not be
scheduled until later.  For <code>purge</code> tasks this wasn't a huge
deal, but for <code>test-store</code> it meant that cloud storage would get
slammed with test after test after test after test as soon as
the SHIELD was unlocked.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>fs</code> plugin no longer functions as a store plugin.  This
configuration was deemed to dangerous in the wild, given the
locality constraints.  If you need local-ish filesystem-backed
storage, check out the <code>webdav</code> plugin.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>WebSocket broadcast receivers are only registered <em>after</em> a
successful upgrade from plain HTTP to WebSockets, to avoid
stalling out the core on badly-behaved clients.</p></li>
<li><p>The CLI now honors <code>-k</code> everywhere it appears.</p></li>
<li><p>It is now possible to update a target / store that was created
without any configuration (no <code>--data</code> on create-*).</p></li>
<li><p>CLI update-* commands now properly display the updated object
attributes, instead of an empty report.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>create-auth-token</code> CLI command now honors <code>--json</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix javascript event handler stacking bugs in the web UI.  In
short, form submissions would "remember" their previous onsubmit
handlers, leading to some <em>very</em> interesting errors on both
client- and server-side.</p></li>

          <h2 id="v8.0.0">SHIELD v8.0.0</h2>
          <p>SHIELD v8 is a marked improvement over previous version of SHIELD.</p>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Multi-Tenancy</em> - SHIELD now supports the notion of tenants, which allow
site operators to group their users logically, and sequester teams from
one another.  Each tenant has its own set of jobs, tasks, archives,
etc., and members of one tenant cannot interact with the resources of
another.  Users can be assigned to multiple tenants, concurrently.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Archive Encryption</em> - SHIELD now leverages AES-256 encryption when
storing backup archives in cloud storage, making sure that your data is
secure, even at-rest.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Agent Registration</em> - SHIELD Agents now register with the SHIELD Core,
and provide metadata to assist operators in the configuration of backup
targets, and cloud storage systems.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Improved Web UI</em> - SHIELD's web-based user interface got a massive
overhaul in this release, with a concerted focus on efficiency and
ease-of-use for operators, and their immediate concerns.</p></li>
<li><p><em>New CLI</em> - The SHIELD CLI has been rewritten from the ground-up to
interface more cleanly with the SHIELD v8 API.  It handles plugin
configuration more naturally, without forcing you to write proper JSON.
Yay.  It also supports a new <code>import</code> function that makes it easy to
ensure that your target and storage systems, jobs, retention policies,
etc. are always correct.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Improved Scheduling</em> - Backup Jobs can now be run every X hours, much
to the delight of SHIELD users everywhere.</p></li>
