        <p>Hello, and welcome to the <strong>SHIELD Operator's Manual</strong>, an in-depth look at
all things SHIELD.  This guide aims to be an exhaustive guide to the
installation and operation of the SHIELD Data Protection solution.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a more easy-going start-up guide, you may want to
check out the <a href="/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a> guide.</p>

<p>If you are interested in contributing to SHIELD itself, or wish to write a
plugin to extend the capabilities of your SHIELD installation, head on over
to the <a href="/devs">SHIELD Developer Documentation</a>.</p>

<h1>What is SHIELD?</h1>

<p>SHIELD is a <em>data protection</em> solution.  It is designed to run scheduled
tasks to backup your important data systems to off-site cloud storage
solutions, and facilitate the restoration of backup archives in the event of
outages or data loss.</p>

<p>SHIELD supports lots of different data systems, through its flexible and
modular plugin architecture.  We currently support:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> databases, via the <a href="/docs/plugins/postgres"><code>postgres</code> plugin</a>.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong> / <strong>MariaDB</strong>, via the <a href="/docs/plugins/mysql"><code>mysql</code> plugin</a>, or the
<a href="/docs/plugins/xtrabackup"><code>xtrabackup</code> plugin</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Redis</strong> key-value store, via the <a href="/docs/plugins/redis"><code>redis</code> plugin</a>.</li>
<li>... and <a href="/docs/plugins#target-plugins">many more</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud Storage systems are likewise pluggable.  Out of the box, SHIELD
supports:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon S3</strong> (and S3 work-alikes) via the <a href="/docs/plugins/s3"><code>s3</code> plugin</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Azure Blobstore</strong> via the <a href="/docs/plugins/azure"><code>azure</code> plugin</a>.</li>
<li><strong>GCP Blobstore</strong> via the <a href="/docs/plugins/google"><code>google</code> plugin</a>.</li>
<li>On-premise <strong>WebDAV</strong> endpoints, via the <a href="/docs/plugins/webdav"><code>webdav</code> plugin</a>.</li>
<li>... and <a href="/docs/plugins/#store-plugins">several others</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>SHIELD is a distributed system.  The SHIELD <em>core</em> leverages a network of
<em>agents</em> to do the heavy lifting of data backup and restore.  When you
deploy SHIELD into your infrastructure, yet get to choose how many agents
you want to provision, and where in the network they sit.</p>

<p><em>Multi-tenancy</em> is baked right into SHIELD via a robust role-based access
control (RBAC) system in place to help isolate different subsets of users
from one another.  People in one tenant are unable to see configurations
made by people in another tenant.  This allows a single SHIELD to support
multiple, independent teams.</p>

<p>SHIELD also supports a sophisticated authentication system.  You can hook
up to your external Cloud Foundry UAA server, a BOSH UAA instance, or even
Github (both public and on-premise).  As users log in via their external
credentials, SHIELD will automatically create the necessary tenants and
assign roles based on the SHIELD configuration.</p>

<p>We believe strongly in encryption.  Whenever SHIELD communicates across the
network, it does so over encrypted channels (SSH, TLS/HTTPS), with endpoint
identity verification (host keys, mutual TLS, etc.).  All backup archives
are encrypted with unique key material, to ensure that data at-rest is also
resistent to snooping and tampering.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Before you can begin to use SHIELD to protect your important data, you're
going to need to install it.  You have two options: via <a href="https://bosh.io">BOSH</a>
(ideal for Cloud Foundry users), or via <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>.</p>

<h2>Planning Your Installation</h2>

<p>Before you start installing the software, it's worthwhile to take a step
back and plan out your installation</p>

<h3>Network Topology</h3>

<p>SHIELD operates best on flat network topologies, without <abbr>NAT</abbr>
devices or HTTP(S) proxy services.</p>

<p>SHIELD requires <em>mutual network visibility</em> between the core and all
cooperating agents.  Each agent issues a small HTTP request to the core,
to inform the core that it is alive, and ready to be inventoried.  This is
called the <em>registration ping</em>.  For each registration ping received, the
core records the name and port given and the remote address of the
connecting TCP socket.  At some later time, the SHIELD core will initiate an
SSH connection to the recorded agent IP address, and gather agent
information.</p>

<p>Because of this, NAT devices tend to confound SHIELD.  The registration ping
originats (at the TCP level) from the NAT gateway, not the host running the
SHIELD agent software.  When the core attempts to connect back to the agent,
it initiates a connection to the <em>NAT device</em> on the agent port, which
generally fails.</p>

<p>Flat networks with HTTP(S) proxies are not impossible, but they can be
unruly.  When configuring proxy clients (via <code>http_proxy</code> / <code>https_proxy</code>,
<code>no_proxy</code> environment varialbes, or similar mechanisms), you will want to
be especially cognizant of the HTTP(S) connections needed by the SHIELD
software itself.  Often, these connections will need to bypass am
Internet-bound proxy (i.e. one in a DMZ) in order to function.</p>

<p>Likewise, if your cloud storage solution is to be dealt with over HTTP(S),
you will need to make sure that either your proxy server can contact it on
behalf of each SHIELD agent, or that each agent blacklists the domains
and/or IP addresses of the storage endpoints in something like <code>no_proxy</code>.</p>

<h3>Where to Colocate SHIELD Agents</h3>

<p>Depending on the data systems you wish to backup, and their configuration
with respect to access control, you may be able to get away without
colocating <em>any</em> SHIELD agents in your infrastructure.</p>

<p>There are really only two reasons for colocating a SHIELD agent on a data
system installation: plugin requirements and host access control
configuration.</p>

<p>Most SHIELD plugins stream their data through, without relying on any
temporary local storage.  This removes a throughput bottleneck (the disk),
as well as a capacity concern (how much temporary space do you need?).  Some
plugins, however, require local disk.  If the target system doesn't require
local access (more on that in a moment), you may want to spin up some
machines with large ephemeral disks just to handle these backup / restore
operations.  The conversation for backing up data then looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/manual/dedicated-shield-agent.png" alt="A Dedicated SHIELD Agent" title=""></p>

<p>Some plugins absolutely cannot be executed across the network.  The
<a href="/docs/plugins/fs">Filesystem Plugin</a>, for example, can only deal with files on the local
filesystem (networked filesystems notwithstanding).  Therefore, if you need
to back up files on a host, you will need to deploy a SHIELD agent to run on
that host.</p>

<h2>Using BOSH</h2>

<p><a href="https://bosh.io">BOSH</a> is a cloud-agnostic deployment and orchestration tool that
excels at lifecycle management of software at all scales.  SHIELD has a
<em>BOSH release</em> that can be used to deploy both the SHIELD core, and SHIELD
agents into new and existing BOSH deployments.</p>

<p>If you're already using BOSH (for example, if you are deploying Cloud
Foundry), adding SHIELD into your infrastructure should be easy.  If you are
still looking for a great release engineering framework, you can get your
feet wet with a SHIELD deployment or three.</p>

<p>The SHIELD BOSH release can be found <a href="https://github.com/starkandwayne/shield-boshrelease/releases">on Github</a>.</p>

<h3>Deploying the SHIELD Core</h3>

<p>Usually, the SHIELD core is a standalone, self-contained deployment.  To
deploy, you'll need to find or create a deployment manifest.  A good
starting point can be found <a href="/docs/manual/shield.yml">here</a>.</p>

<p>Save that file locally, as <code>shield.yml</code>, and then run:</p>

<pre><code>$ bosh -e my-bosh deploy \
    -d shield \
    -v static_ip=192.0.2.5 \
    -v domain=shield.example.com \
    shield.yml
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>domain</code> with the FQDN of your SHIELD management console, and
<code>192.0.2.5</code> with a static IP that you want to deploy SHIELD on.  You may
need to consult your BOSH <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config">cloud-config</a> to find a suitable IP in
the <code>default</code> network.  Optionally, you may modify the deployment manifest
to specify a different network.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The provided deployment manifest assumes that your BOSH director
has been deployed with a <em>config-server</em> that can generate the necessary
certificates and keys for securing SHIELD's communications.  If that is not
the case, you will need to provide additional command-line options to the
<code>bosh deploy</code> command to store the generated credentials locally.  See
<a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-int/#vars-store">the BOSH documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Once BOSH has finished deploying SHIELD, you should be able to access the
SHIELD management console at <a href="#">https://$IP</a>.  The default login will be
<code>admin</code> (username) and <code>shield</code> (password).</p>

<h3>Deploying SHIELD Agents</h3>

<p>If you need to colocate agents on other BOSH deployments, you have a few
options.  The fastest method is to modify those deployment manifests to
include the <code>shield-agent</code> job in the appropriate BOSH instance groups, like
this:</p>

<pre><code>instance_groups:
  - name: some-database
    jobs:
      # ... other jobs ....
      - name:    shield-agent
        release: shield

    # ... rest of configuration ...
</code></pre>

<p>This can get out of hand fast.  A more elegant solution is to use <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config">BOSH
runtime configs</a> and <em>inject</em> the SHIELD agent job into other
deployments without mucking about with their deployment manifests.</p>

<p>Here's a working runtime config:</p>

<pre><code>---
releases:
  - name:    shield
    version: 8.0.8

addons:
  - name: shield
    jobs:
      - name:    shield-agent
        release: shield
</code></pre>

<p>To use this, update your existing runtime-config:</p>

<pre><code>$ bosh update-runtime-config addons.yml
</code></pre>

<p>Then, <code>bosh deploy</code> your pre-existing manifests, without changing them.
For more information, including how to limit the <code>shield</code> addon to just
specific deployments / VMs, read the
<a href="https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config">BOSH runtime-configs documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuration Reference</h2>

<p>This section contains detailed descriptions of all configuration options for
the SHIELD core, and SHIELD agents.</p>

<h3>SHIELD Core Configuration File Reference</h3>

<p>The SHIELD core configuration file is a YAML file, read at started by the
<code>shieldd</code> binary.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>listen_addr</strong> - The IP address and TCP port that the SHIELD core daemon
should bind to and listen on for incoming API (HTTP) requests.  Defaults
to <code>*:8888</code>.  <code>*</code> is interpreted to mean <em>all interfaces</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>workers</strong> - How many worker threads should the SHIELD core spin.  This
defaults to <code>2</code>, but you should increase the 1.5 times the number of
concurrent backup tasks you expect to see, at peak.</p>

<p>Low worker counts can cause the SHIELD scheduler to "stall out" and not
execute scheduled tasks in a timely fashion.  The 1.5x multiplier accounts
for purge operations, cloud storage tests, and other background tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>debug</strong> - Whether or not to enable verbose debug logging.  This is a
boolean, and it defaults to <code>no</code>, which is a sane choice for any
production or staging environment.  Debug logging is verbose, and very
low-level.  It is of primary value to SHIELD developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>data_directory</strong> - The absolute path to the directory where SHIELD will
store all of its persistent data.  Important files stored here include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$data_directory/shield.db</code> - The SHIELD metadata database.</li>
<li><code>$data_directory/vault/*</code> - The encrypted files that back the vault.</li>
<li><code>$data_directory/vault.crypt</code> - The encrypted file which stores the seal
keys to the SHIELD Vault.  This file is encrypted with the SHIELD master
password.</li>
<li><code>$data_directory/bootstrap.log</code> - A log of what occurred during a SHIELD
<em>from-nothing</em> recovery.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>fast_loop</strong> - The frequency, in seconds, of the SHIELD scheduler's "fast
loop."  On every iteration of the fast loop, SHIELD will schedule backup
jobs that ought to run, execute pending tasks (if it has workers available),
and handle inbound agent registration pings.</p>

<p>By default, the fast loop executes once a second.  Unles you have an
urgent need otherwise, you shouldn't change this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>slow_loop</strong> - The frequency, in seconds, of the SHIELD scheduler's "slow
loop."  The slow loop handles administrative tasks for the SHIELD core,
including archive expiration and purgation, session clearing, data
analytics, and cloud storage testing.</p>

<p>By default, the slow loop exucutes once every 300 seconds (5 minutes).
Turning up the frequency will result in higher load on external cloud
storage systems.  Decreasing the frequency will cause expired archives to
remain in cloud storage for longer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>web_root</strong> - The root path to the SHIELD web management UI assets.
Defaults to the relative path <code>web</code>, which is probably not what you want.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>environment</strong> - An name for the environment, that SHIELD will pass
through to clients accessing its API and web management console.  This can
be useful for differentiating your staging SHIELD from your production
SHIELD.  By default, no environment is set.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>color</strong> - You can color code your SHIELD Web User Interfaces!  Set a hex
value here (i.e. <code>##003300</code>) or other CSS-compatible color identifier, and
the web UI will use it to colorize the environment name.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>motd</strong> - A (hopefully) short message to display to operators on the
login screen.  You can use this for compliance messages, important
notices, an explanation of which authentication method people should use,
who to contact for help, etc.  By default, there is no MOTD.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>vault_address</strong> - The URL of the SHIELD Vault.  This should almost
always be <code>https://127.0.0.1:8200</code>.  If you are using the BOSH release,
this cannot be configured.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>vault_ca_cert</strong> - The X.509 Certificate Authority certificate,
PEM-encoded, for validating the Vault certificate.  If you are using the
BOSH release, this cannot be configured (nor does it need to be).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>encryption_type</strong> - Which encryption algorithm and chaining mode to use
for encrypting backup archives.  Supported values are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>aes256-ctr</code> - 256-bit AES, in Counter CBC mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>We plan to introduce more types as the need arises.</p>

<p>Each backup archive tracks which encryption type was in force when it was
taken, to allow operators to change this value without rendering previous
backup archives unusable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>session_timeout</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>failsafe</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>username</strong></li>
<li><strong>password</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>SHIELD Agent Configuration File Reference</h3>

<p>TDB</p>

<h1>Using SHIELD</h1>

<p>SHIELD features a beautiful web user interface and a robust command-line
interface.  We like to think of the web UI as providing more visibility into
the configuration of SHIELD, while the CLI provides more flexibility in
terms of automation.</p>

<h2>The Web UI</h2>

<p>You can access the web UI by pointing your browser at the IP address of your
SHIELD core installation.  SHIELD forces all HTTP traffic over TLS, via port
443, for security reasons.</p>

<h3>Logging In</h3>

<p>Before you can interact with SHIELD, you must log in.</p>

<p><img src="/docs/manual/ui/login-screen.png" alt="The SHIELD Web UI Login Screen" title=""></p>

<p>On the right is the login form for local authentication.  On the left is a
list of the configured <em>authentication providers</em>.  These allow SHIELD
administrators to integrate SHIELD authentication with 3rd-party, external
identity systems like Github, or Cloud Foundry UAA.</p>

<p>Note: You may not have any authentication providers listed.</p>

<h3>The Heads-up Display</h3>

<p>All logged in?  Great!</p>

<p>At the top of the screen, you should see the <em>heads-up display</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/manual/ui/hud.png" alt="The SHIELD Heads-Up Display" title=""></p>

<p>To the left is identifying information about this SHIELD core, including the
configured SHIELD environment name, the IP address and/or fully-qualified
domain, and the version of SHIELD.</p>

<p>The first pane summarizes the overall health of SHIELD and the current
tenant's configuration.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>SHIELD is ...</strong> - Reports the current status of the SHIELD API.
If all is well, this will say <em>SHIELD is up</em>, in a reassuring green hue.
If the SHIELD core is not responding to API calls, this will say <em>SHIELD
is DOWN</em>, in red.  Sometimes, it may report that the SHIELD is locked,
in which case an administrator needs to intervene to unlock it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cloud Storage is ...</strong> - Reports the health of all global cloud
storage systems, as well as the health of all cloud storage specific to
the currently selected tenant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jobs are ...</strong> - Reports the status of all backup jobs for the current
tenant.  It considers only the most recent execution of each job,
whether it was scheduled or run manually (ad hoc).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The second pane, titled <em>Data Protection Summary</em>, provides some numbers for your
consideration.  All of these are per-tenant.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scheduled Backup Jobs</strong> - How many total jobs are scheduled to run.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backup Archives</strong> - How many backup archives exist.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cloud Storage Used</strong> - How much of cloud storage is being used by the
backup archives for this tenant's jobs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Daily Storage Increase</strong> - A simple linear projection of the amount of
additional cloud storage that will be used, each day, given the current
schedules, retention policies, and archive sizes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The heads-up display is partially dependent on the current tenant, so if you
switch to a different tenant, you might get different numbers / statuses.</p>

<h3>The Task Sidebar</h3>

<p>To the left of the screen is a sidebar with links to the common tasks you
may want to perform:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run an ad hoc backup</li>
<li>Restore data from a backup</li>
<li>Configure a new backup job</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Top Bar</h3>

<p>TBD</p>

<h3>The Navigation Bar</h3>

<p>The black navigation bar (immediately under the heads-up display) will stick
to the top of the viewport as you scroll.  It provides top-level navigation,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Systems</strong> - Your data systems are the things that SHIELD protects, by
making copies of the important data contained within them, on a scheduled
and recurring basis.  THis page lets you review and manage those systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Storage</strong> - Cloud storage is where SHIELD keeps the backup copies of
your data.  You can configure however many storage systems you want, in
whatever configuration you deem appropriate.  This page lets you access
both global (shared) cloud storage systems, and those specific to your
tenant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Retention</strong> - SHIELD doesn't keep backup archives forever.  Every backup
job needs a <em>retention policy</em> so that SHIELD knows when it is okay to
delete older archives, to conserve space.  This page lets you review and
manage those policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Admin</strong> - This one is for SHIELD administrators only.  It provides
access to a host of administrative functions like tenant and user
management, global cloud storage management, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
